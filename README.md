# maths-python

An educational interactive web application that provides Python code snippets for mathematics and statistics. The application covers topics including calculus (differentiation and integration), stochastic calculus, linear algebra, and probability distributions. Each topic presents mathematical theory alongside executable Python code examples using libraries like SymPy, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

Built with Streamlit, the application organises content into navigable pages where users can explore mathematical concepts through LaTeX-rendered equations and interactive visualizations. Users can adjust parameters with sliders and inputs to see how mathematical operations behave with different values, making it a useful reference for learning computational mathematics.

The codebase follows a modular architecture where each Python file in the `app/pages/` directory automatically becomes a page in the application. This makes it straightforward to add new mathematical topics by creating new page files following the established patterns.
